# My-Blog
<d>Diving into the habit of bloging. </d>

<p>This little blog is to document my journey.<br> I'm in the process of developing useful assets as well as to showcase new hurdles that I overcome. </p>

<d>Feel free to hop along.</d>

<d>For this blog I have used the tutorial by Sarah Gibson from the Youtube tutorial : [Tutorial: Blogging with Hugo and GitHub Pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_STFQc9Y2zY&t=702s)</d>
